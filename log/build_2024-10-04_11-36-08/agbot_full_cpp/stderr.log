[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findagbot_full_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "agbot_full_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "agbot_full_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    agbot_full_msgsConfig.cmake
    agbot_full_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "agbot_full_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "agbot_full_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "agbot_full_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
